# CSE338-Airline-Management
This is our submission of the Software Testing, Validation & Verification course in Ain Shams University faculty of Computer Engineering and Software Systems(CESS) During the Spring 23/24 semester.

The project is about a Library management system where we're introduced to the core concepts of Software Testing and putting them into action , it enriches our experience with producing high quality applications using a deterministic approach where the the software is properly documented and the outcome is already studied before the actual development. Till now, most if not all of our projects' development were non-deterministic(ie. we develop using an exploratory approach where after developing a part we might not have plans for the next phase). But in this project we use a very well documented specification document to guide our development phase, the test cases are created with respect to the definition of the components under test before the components are even developed, in this project we are also introduced to the concepts of automated testing using the rich framework of JUnit 5.4.0 which is widely used in the the modern testing era, the project is in Java with maven framework with testing using JUnit dependencies, coupled with a more modern GUI that promotes UX with it's many dynamic components, made using Scenebuilder.
